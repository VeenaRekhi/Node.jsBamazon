*** BAMAZON - AN INSTOCKS APP ***

In this project we are creating an Amazon-like storefront with the MySQL data-storing skills. The app will take in orders from customers and deplete stock from the store's inventory. In the last third stage, we aregoing to  program our app to track product sales across a store's departments and then provide a summary of the highest-grossing departments in the store.
